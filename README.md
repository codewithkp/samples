Thank you for your patience. I wanted to share a brief update and also clarify the purpose of the optimisation application.

The primary goal of the system is to identify hotspots and inefficiencies in query patterns, and on that front, the application is performing exactly as intended. As mentioned earlier, based on our current understanding, we have been able to identify multiple optimisation opportunities and suggest specific areas where improvements can be made.

That said, to implement the optimal recommendations, we do require functional expertise from your side. Many of these queries are tightly coupled with business logic, and without clarity on their functional intent, there is a risk of altering the behaviour. Our aim is to ensure the optimisation is both technically sound and functionally accurate. This naturally takes time as the team analyses the queries with the limited functional context available.

We truly value the collaborative effort here, and your guidance on the functional side will help us refine and accelerate the optimisation process.

Additionally, we have identified two new query patterns that show significant improvement potential — one with ~70% scan reduction and another with ~100% scan reduction. Both of these queries are executed daily, which means they could deliver meaningful cost benefits once implemented. However, the exact cost impact will be clearer after applying these changes in your DEV or TEST environment, where execution frequency and data volumes reflect your real workload.

Please let us know if we can walk through these findings together or if someone from the functional team can review the logic with us. This will help ensure the recommendations are applied correctly and safely.

Thanks again for the continued collaboration.
